THINGS I CARE ABOUT

#1 – Giving 110% to everything: I give it my all to every task, consistently striving to go above and beyond to deliver exceptional work—whether it’s a small or complex project. I pay attention to the smallest details, ensuring that no aspect is overlooked. This approach allows me to produce work that is not only of high quality, but also demonstrates my passion, dedication and strong work ethic.


#2 – Shipping: I believe version 1 is the initial chapter of the story you’re telling with the product. I adhere to the principle of “First do it, then do it right, then do it better”—embracing the concept of iteration and ongoing enhancement in all facets of my work. Moreover, I understand that it is not always about adding new elements; sometimes, the key lies in subtracting and removing unnecessary components. This may mean that sometimes I value saying no more often than saying yes, prioritizing tasks and commitments to ensure focus on the most impactful and meaningful work.

#3 – Continuous learning and growth: I believe in continuous learning and improvement, both in my professional and personal life. In the workplace, I embrace shipping early and often and learning from both successes and failures. This approach fosters an environment which promotes growth and resilience. I thrive in a fast-paced product velocity and feel fulfilled in working within rapid build > ship > learn cycles. This enables us to deliver value quickly to our users and make an impact.

#4 – Work-life balance: I prioritize the health and happiness of myself and the team by fostering a supportive and trustworthy environment. I believe in an inclusive work environment where everyone feels valued and respected. I bring a positive attitude and a sense of fun and enjoyment to the workplace.

#5 – Think globally, act locally: I believe in thinking globally while starting locally, considering the broader context while taking practical actions to deliver meaningful impact to the product. Rather than designing for a hypothetical world or making decisions based on insufficient data, I prioritize making informed choices that align with the reality we face.


#6 – Transparency and openness: I value honest and open communication with my teammates and my lead. In a team setting, I believe everyone should feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and ideas without any judgment. I always keep an open mind by embracing new ideas and perspectives.


#7 – Trust, accountability and reliability: I recognize that trust is established through fulfilling commitments. I take complete ownership of my actions, even in cases where mistakes occur or deadlines are not met. By holding myself accountable, I uphold trust and demonstrate my reliability. I hold the same expectation for my teammates, as I believe that mutual accountability is essential for maintaining a trustworthy team dynamic.

#8 – Short and actionable meetings: I prefer short and actionable meetings with quick decision making to respect everyone’s time. Long meetings can be very draining and should only be reserved to discuss critical irreversible decisions. I recognize the importance of implementing structure and processes (loose or rigid) at a certain point to enhance efficiency and ensure consistent results.

ENNEAGRAM

Type: 5 (Investigator, Specialist, Observer)

Strengths: During a crisis, I maintain a calm demeanor and approach situations with objectivity. I have a strong aptitude for acquiring knowledge, simplifying complexity, and developing expertise. By setting boundaries, I effectively manage my time and thrive in an environment that grants me uninterrupted focus and autonomy, as it allows for effective decision-making through mental processing. I also evaluate things using a combination of analysis and insight, as this approach enhances the quality and effectiveness of my decisions.

Weaknesses: My inclination towards quietness sometimes results in others having limited understanding of my skills and capabilities. However, I am actively working on being more open and sharing whenever possible. This can make it challenging for others to fully appreciate me, and I may feel a lack of recognition. Additionally, my frugal approach to resource management may be seen as miserly and stingy by others, but I consider myself a pragmatic designer with experience in startups that demand being smart about resourcing. The need for solitude can give the impression of being reclusive, and protecting my privacy may lead to being perceived as withdrawn. However, it’s worth noting that I consider myself somewhere between an introvert and an extrovert.
